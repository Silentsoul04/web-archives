<p>In order to report a vulnerability, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:Vulnerability@kaspersky.com">Vulnerability@kaspersky.com</a>. To encrypt your message, use this <a href="http://media.kaspersky.com/utilities/pgp_key.txt">PGP key</a>. Provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contact details. Kaspersky specialists require information about how to address you and contact you for clarification of the data about the vulnerability you have discovered. </li>
<li>The name of the product in which you discovered the vulnerability, along with its version number and your device’s operating system.</li>
<li>Describe in detail the vulnerability you have discovered so that we can determine the nature and scale of the issue.</li>
<li>Please tell us whether you are planning to give information about the vulnerability to a third party.
<br />
<p>We kindly request that you do not publish any information about the vulnerability until it has been fixed by our specialists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Kaspersky will analyze the information you provide, work to remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner, and inform you of the results.</p>
<p>Kaspersky reserves the right to decide whether or not to further disclose information about the vulnerability.</p>

<br />
<p>Based on our product’s threat model, attacks on the communication channel within remote management services (configuration, update, etc.) can be implemented on any target system regardless of user activity. Thus, by using a man-in-the-middle attack, arbitrary code can be remotely executed in high privilege antivirus processes. As a result, malware code will work as part of an antivirus product and bypass detection technologies. We take this possibility very seriously.</p>
<p class="yellow-b">A special bounty of $100,000 will be awarded for high-quality report with a Proof of Concept (PoC) that implements this attack vector.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>[1] – A report with test cases that includes a detailed step by step description of the vulnerability implementation.
<br />
[2] – A high quality report with a proof of concept (should demonstrate that vulnerability is possible). Exploits that take an excessive amount of time to run or are otherwise not credible may not be accepted (<a href="https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/articles/211538803-Step-by-Step-How-to-write-a-good-vulnerability-report" target="_blank" title="recommendations">HackerOne recommendations</a>).

					<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Kaspersky has fixed a security issue in Kaspersky Password Manager product for several platforms (CVE-2020-27020). Password generator was not completely cryptographically strong and potentially allowed an attacker to predict generated passwords in some cases. An attacker would need to know some additional information (for example, time of password generation).</p>
<p>All public versions of Kaspersky Password Manager liable to this issue now have a new logic of password generation and a passwords update alert for cases when a generated password is probably not strong enough.</p>
<h3>List of affected applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kaspersky Password Manager for Windows prior to 9.2 Patch F</li>
<li>Kaspersky Password Manager for Android prior to 9.2.14.872</li>
<li>Kaspersky Password Manager for iOS prior to 9.2.14.31</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed versions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kaspersky Password Manager for Windows 9.2 Patch F</li>
<li>Kaspersky Password Manager for Android 9.2.14.872</li>
<li>Kaspersky Password Manager for iOS 9.2.14.31</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend our users to check the application version and install the latest updates. To make the process of receiving updates easier, our home products support automatic updates.</p>

					<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Kaspersky has fixed a security issue in consumer and corporate products that was publicly disclosed earlier (CVE-2020-26200). A component of our boot loader allowed loading of untrusted UEFI modules due to insufficient check of their authenticity. This component is incorporated in Kaspersky Rescue Disk (KRD) and was trusted by the Authentication Agent of Full Disk Encryption in Kaspersky Endpoint Security (KES). This issue allowed to bypass the UEFI Secure Boot security feature. An attacker would need physical access to the computer to exploit it. Otherwise, local administrator privileges would be required to modify the boot loader component.</p>

Depending on the product, this could allow an attacker to elevate privileges in the OS, provided that the vulnerable component works within the context of process with high privileges. At the moment of exploitation an attacker must be already authenticated in the system (local attack). In case of such products as consumer Kaspersky Anti-Virus products family and Endpoint Security, an attacker also needs to bypass product's self-defense to perform exploitation.</p>
<p>We have not registered any attempts to exploit this vulnerability in the wild.</p>

					<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Kaspersky has fixed a security issue CVE-2019-15689 found in Kaspersky Secure Connection 4.0 (2020). One of the product executable files was susceptible to a DLL hijacking attack that could potentially allow third-parties to locally execute arbitrary code in its process context. The severity of the issue was assessed as low, because an attacker must have administrator privileges to drop malicious DLL file into the product's folder. No privilege escalation. Issue category: DLL hijacking. Issue type: Arbitrary Code Execution.</p>
<p>We also have fixed three bugs in one of anti-virus (AV) engine components that is responsible for work with ZIP archives. The fix for this component corrects its behaviour in situation of antivirus scanning specially crafted ZIP archives. These malformed archives could be used to circumvent our antivirus scan process. The bugs affected Kaspersky products with antivirus databases.</p>

				<div id="note" class="hidden">
					<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Kaspersky Lab has fixed a vulnerability found by Cybellum Technologies which made a DLL Hijacking attack possible, via an undocumented feature of Microsoft Application Verifier. This allows the attacker to inject code into most OS processes, not just security solutions. It should be mentioned that this attack can only be performed thorough a local vector, when the attacker has already penetrated the device. The attacker has to infect the attacked computer with malicious software in advance, and escalate its privilege on the device in order to register a new Application Verifier Provider DLL – both actions require an attacker to use a range of other tools.</p>

<br />
<h3><strong>Fixed Versions</strong></h3>
<p>The detection and blocking of this malicious scenario has been added to all Kaspersky Lab products from 22 March. In order to stay protected, Kaspersky Lab recommends all customers keep their security solutions up to date and do not disable behavior-based detection features.</p>
<p>Kaspersky Lab will also incorporate additional protection measures into the next updates to its flagship security products. These will block the attack attempts described at different levels. The security solutions to be updated accordingly are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2018</li>
<li>Kaspersky Internet Security 2018</li>
<li>Kaspersky Total Security 2018</li>
<li>Kaspersky Small Office Security 2018</li>

					<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Kaspersky Lab has fixed a number of vulnerabilities found by Mr. Tavis Ormandy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific scenarios existed when unprivileged user might read file with a private key created by product for managing SSL connection. This could be used by attacker/malware with access to a host in order to obtain this file to perform targeted attacks on SSL connections initiated by browser application on the host.
<br /></li>
<li>If user navigated to a web site with invalid SSL certificate and decided to trust it by selecting Continue on the product's warning in order to access the site, product added the certificate to trusted root incorrectly. That might be used by attacker to skip invalid certificate warning if user access sites that were listed in Subject Alternative Names of the original invalid SSL certificate.
<br /></li>
<li>SSL certificate caching error existed that might be used by attacker with a control of network in order to perform targeted attack on a host to intercept SSL connections initiated by browser application specifically by using IP address instead of a domain name.

					<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<div>Kaspersky Lab has identified that below mentioned products are susceptible to memory corruptions, while scanning malformed files of RAR format. These vulnerabilities have maximum security impact of remote code execution and could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the Antivirus process. In order to exploit the vulnerabilities an attacker should convince user to upload maliciously malformed RAR file from external resources. This, for example, might be done by convincing a user to download malicious file from specially crafted website or by sending him a malicious file via e-mail. Memory corruptions might possibly occurred while scanning this file. The fix addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying processing of malformed RAR format.

					<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<div>Kaspersky Lab has fixed a number of vulnerabilities found by Mr. Tavis Ormandy:</div>
<div>- ACL on Kaspersky's directory allowed unprivileged users to create a new file in ProgramData system folder. This could be used by attackers with access to a host in order to create a malicious file that might be then loaded by Antivirus process. CVSS score of this vulnerability is 4.1 (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&amp;version=2&amp;vector=%28AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P%29">AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P</a>).</div>
<div>- X.509 certificates handling was vulnerable to path traversal attack. This could be used by attacker to create a certificate file outside the temporary folder where they are stored during the time of validation. After certificate validation the file is deleted. In order to exploit the vulnerability an attacker could convince users to visit a web site with a specially crafted X.509 certificate. CVSS score of 5.0 (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&amp;version=2&amp;vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N%29">AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N</a>).</div>
<div>- Virtual Keyboard functionality was vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This could be used by attackers with access to a host to read any PNG file on disk C. CVSS score of 1.5 (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&amp;version=2&amp;vector=%28AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N%29">AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N</a>).</div>
