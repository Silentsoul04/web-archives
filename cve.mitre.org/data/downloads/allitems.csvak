CVE-2021-25139,Candidate,"A potential security vulnerability has been identified in the HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager v1.20. The HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager is an application that is installed in a VMWare or Microsoft Hyper-V environment that is used to setup and configure an HPE Moonshot 1500 chassis.

CVE-2021-25216,Candidate,"In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210521-0006/   |   CONFIRM:https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2021-25215   |   URL:https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2021-25215   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4909   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4909   |   MISC:https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-657/   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20210504 [SECURITY] [DLA 2647-1] bind9 security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00001.html   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210428 ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/29/1   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210429 Re: ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/29/2   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210429 Re: ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/29/3   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210429 Re: ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/29/4",Assigned (20210115),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients.

CVE-2021-26932,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as used by Xen. Grant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where a number of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success or failure of each one is reported to the backend driver, and the backend driver then loops over the results, performing follow-up actions based on the success or failure of each operation. Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery.

CVE-2021-27850,Candidate,"A critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability was found all recent versions of Apache Tapestry. The affected versions include 5.4.5, 5.5.0, 5.6.2 and 5.7.0. The vulnerability I have found is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2019-0195. Recap: Before the fix of CVE-2019-0195 it was possible to download arbitrary class files from the classpath by providing a crafted asset file URL. An attacker was able to download the file `AppModule.class` by requesting the URL `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class` which contains a HMAC secret key. The fix for that bug was a blacklist filter that checks if the URL ends with `.class`, `.properties` or `.xml`. Bypass: Unfortunately, the blacklist solution can simply be bypassed by appending a `/` at the end of the URL: `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class/` The slash is stripped after the blacklist check and the file `AppModule.class` is loaded into the response. This class usually contains the HMAC secret key which is used to sign serialized Java objects. With the knowledge of that key an attacker can sign a Java gadget chain that leads to RCE (e.g. CommonsBeanUtils1 from ysoserial). Solution for this vulnerability: * For Apache Tapestry 5.4.0 to 5.6.1, upgrade to 5.6.2 or later. * For Apache Tapestry 5.7.0, upgrade to 5.7.1 or later.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210528-0002/   |   MISC:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r237ff7f286bda31682c254550c1ebf92b0ec61329b32fbeb2d1c8751%40%3Cusers.tapestry.apache.org%3E   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r237ff7f286bda31682c254550c1ebf92b0ec61329b32fbeb2d1c8751%40%3Cusers.tapestry.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210414 CVE-2021-27850: Apache Tapestry: Bypass of the fix for CVE-2019-0195   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/15/1",Assigned (20210301),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-27851,Candidate,"A security vulnerability that can lead to local privilege escalation has been found in &#8217;guix-daemon&#8217;. It affects multi-user setups in which &#8217;guix-daemon&#8217; runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file.

CVE-2021-28543,Candidate,"Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.","FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-2ad352ec70   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OPFBRQUJNWHCB3GQHSSAPRLQU6Q6PY43/   |   MISC:https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00006.html",Assigned (20210316),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-29427,Candidate,"In Gradle from version 5.1 and before version 7.0 there is a vulnerability which can lead to information disclosure and/or dependency poisoning. Repository content filtering is a security control Gradle introduced to help users specify what repositories are used to resolve specific dependencies. This feature was introduced in the wake of the ""A Confusing Dependency"" blog post. In some cases, Gradle may ignore content filters and search all repositories for dependencies. This only occurs when repository content filtering is used from within a `pluginManagement` block in a settings file. This may change how dependencies are resolved for Gradle plugins and build scripts. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks: 1) Information disclosure: Gradle could make dependency requests to repositories outside your organization and leak internal package identifiers. 2) Dependency poisoning/Dependency confusion: Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For a full example and more details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory. The problem has been patched and released with Gradle 7.0. Users relying on this feature should upgrade their build as soon as possible. As a workaround, users may use a company repository which has the right rules for fetching packages from public repositories, or use project level repository content filtering, inside `buildscript.repositories`. This option is available since Gradle 5.1 when the feature was introduced.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-jvmj-rh6q-x395   |   URL:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-jvmj-rh6q-x395   |   MISC:https://docs.gradle.org/7.0/release-notes.html#security-advisories   |   URL:https://docs.gradle.org/7.0/release-notes.html#security-advisories",Assigned (20210330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-29428,Candidate,"In Gradle before version 7.0, on Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it.

This vulnerability impacted builds using precompiled script plugins written in Kotlin DSL and tests for Gradle plugins written using ProjectBuilder or TestKit. If you are on Windows or modern versions of macOS, you are not vulnerable. If you are on a Unix-like operating system with the ""sticky"" bit set on your system temporary directory, you are not vulnerable. The problem has been patched and released with Gradle 7.0. As a workaround, on Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the ""sticky"" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. If you are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory, you can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only. For additional details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-89qm-pxvm-p336   |   URL:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-89qm-pxvm-p336   |   MISC:https://docs.gradle.org/7.0/release-notes.html#security-advisories   |   URL:https://docs.gradle.org/7.0/release-notes.html#security-advisories   |   MISC:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/15240   |   URL:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/15240   |   MISC:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/15654   |   URL:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/15654",Assigned (20210330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-29429,Candidate,"In Gradle before version 7.0, files created with open permissions in the system temporary directory can allow an attacker to access information downloaded by Gradle. Some builds could be vulnerable to a local information disclosure. Remote files accessed through TextResourceFactory are downloaded into the system temporary directory first. Sensitive information contained in these files can be exposed to other local users on the same system. If you do not use the `TextResourceFactory` API, you are not vulnerable. As of Gradle 7.0, uses of the system temporary directory have been moved to the Gradle User Home directory. By default, this directory is restricted to the user running the build. As a workaround, set a more restrictive umask that removes read access to other users. When files are created in the system temporary directory, they will not be accessible to other users.

CVE-2021-29472,Candidate,"Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system.

CVE-2021-29474,Candidate,"HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker can read arbitrary `.md` files from the server's filesystem due to an improper input validation, which results in the ability to perform a relative path traversal. To verify if you are affected, you can try to open the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/..%2F..%2FREADME#` (replace `http://localhost:3000` with your instance's base-URL e.g. `https://demo.hedgedoc.org/..%2F..%2FREADME#`). If you see a README page being rendered, you run an affected version. The attack works due the fact that the internal router passes the url-encoded alias to the `noteController.showNote`-function. This function passes the input directly to findNote() utility function, that will pass it on the the parseNoteId()-function, that tries to make sense out of the noteId/alias and check if a note already exists and if so, if a corresponding file on disk was updated. If no note exists the note creation-function is called, which pass this unvalidated alias, with a `.md` appended, into a path.join()-function which is read from the filesystem in the follow up routine and provides the pre-filled content of the new note. This allows an attacker to not only read arbitrary `.md` files from the filesystem, but also observes changes to them. The usefulness of this attack can be considered limited, since mainly markdown files are use the file-ending `.md` and all markdown files contained in the hedgedoc project, like the README, are public anyway. If other protections such as a chroot or container or proper file permissions are in place, this attack's usefulness is rather limited. On a reverse-proxy level one can force a URL-decode, which will prevent this attack because the router will not accept such a path.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-p528-555r-pf87   |   URL:https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-p528-555r-pf87",Assigned (20210330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-29475,Candidate,"HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `""allowPDFExport"": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-pxxg-px9v-6qf3   |   URL:https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-pxxg-px9v-6qf3   |   MISC:https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65   |   URL:https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65",Assigned (20210330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-29486,Candidate,"cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like [""1"",""2"",""3"",""4"",""5""] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`. This vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the library. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library). Users should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version. Tests for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by throwing a `TypeError()` instead of processing it. Developers using this library may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError. Apps performing proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by this patch. The vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/security/advisories/GHSA-58qp-5328-v7mh   |   URL:https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/security/advisories/GHSA-58qp-5328-v7mh   |   MISC:https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/issues/7   |   URL:https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/issues/7   |   MISC:https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/pull/8   |   URL:https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/pull/8   |   MISC:https://www.npmjs.com/package/cumulative-distribution-function   |   URL:https://www.npmjs.com/package/cumulative-distribution-function",Assigned (20210330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-29504,Candidate,"WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. An improper error handling in HTTPS requests management in WP-CLI version 0.12.0 and later allows remote attackers able to intercept the communication to remotely disable the certificate verification on WP-CLI side, gaining full control over the communication content, including the ability to impersonate update servers and push malicious updates towards WordPress instances controlled by the vulnerable WP-CLI agent, or push malicious updates toward WP-CLI itself. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the default behavior of `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()` when encountering a TLS handshake error is to disable certificate validation and retry the same request. The default behavior has been changed with version 2.5.0 of WP-CLI and the `wp-cli/wp-cli` framework (via https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523) so that the `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()` method accepts an `$insecure` option that is `false` by default and consequently that a TLS handshake failure is a hard error by default. This new default is a breaking change and ripples through to all consumers of `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()`, including those in separate WP-CLI bundled or third-party packages. https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523 has also added an `--insecure` flag to the `cli update` command to counter this breaking change. There is no direct workaround for the default insecure behavior of `wp-cli/wp-cli` versions before 2.5.0. The workaround for dealing with the breaking change in the commands directly affected by the new secure default behavior is to add the `--insecure` flag to manually opt-in to the previous insecure behavior.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/security/advisories/GHSA-rwgm-f83r-v3qj   |   URL:https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/security/advisories/GHSA-rwgm-f83r-v3qj   |   MISC:https://github.com/wp-cli/checksum-command/pull/86   |   URL:https://github.com/wp-cli/checksum-command/pull/86   |   MISC:https://github.com/wp-cli/config-command/pull/128   |   URL:https://github.com/wp-cli/config-command/pull/128   |   MISC:https://github.com/wp-cli/core-command/pull/186   |   URL:https://github.com/wp-cli/core-command/pull/186   |   MISC:https://github.com/wp-cli/extension-command/pull/287   |   URL:https://github.com/wp-cli/extension-command/pull/287   |   MISC:https://github.com/wp-cli/package-command/pull/138   |   URL:https://github.com/wp-cli/package-command/pull/138   |   MISC:https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523   |   URL:https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523",Assigned (20210330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-29509,Candidate,"Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue.

The user controls the values of `input_size[i]` and `pooling_ratio_[i]` (via the `value.shape()` and `pooling_ratio` arguments). If the value in `input_size[i]` is smaller than the `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then the floor operation results in `output_size[i]` being 0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of debug mode, so in released versions of TF this does not trigger.

CVE-2021-32618,Candidate,"The Python ""Flask-Security-Too"" package is used for adding security features to your Flask application. It is an is an independently maintained version of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. All versions of Flask-Security-Too allow redirects after many successful views (e.g. /login) by honoring the ?next query param. There is code in FS to validate that the url specified in the next parameter is either relative OR has the same netloc (network location) as the requesting URL. This check utilizes Pythons urlsplit library. However many browsers are very lenient on the kind of URL they accept and 'fill in the blanks' when presented with a possibly incomplete URL. As a concrete example - setting http://login?next=\\\github.com will pass FS's relative URL check however many browsers will gladly convert this to http://github.com. Thus an attacker could send such a link to an unwitting user, using a legitimate site and have it redirect to whatever site they want. This is considered a low severity due to the fact that if Werkzeug is used (which is very common with Flask applications) as the WSGI layer, it by default ALWAYS ensures that the Location header is absolute - thus making this attack vector mute. It is possible for application writers to modify this default behavior by setting the 'autocorrect_location_header=False`.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/security/advisories/GHSA-6qmf-fj6m-686c   |   URL:https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/security/advisories/GHSA-6qmf-fj6m-686c   |   MISC:https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/issues/486   |   URL:https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/issues/486",Assigned (20210512),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-32629,Candidate,"Cranelift is an open-source code generator maintained by Bytecode Alliance. It translates a target-independent intermediate representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation, specifically: * if the heap has bounds checks, and * does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization: the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes those bits as the sign extension of the i32&#8217;s MSB. The issue would thus occur when: * An i32 value in a Wasm program is greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000; * The value is spilled and reloaded by the register allocator due to high register pressure in the program between the value&#8217;s definition and its use; * The value is produced by an instruction that we know to be &#8220;special&#8221; in that it zeroes the upper 32 bits of its destination: add, sub, mul, and, or; * The value is then zero-extended to 64 bits in the Wasm program; * The resulting 64-bit value is used. Under these circumstances there is a potential sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted for heap accesses zero-extends the Wasm heap address, adds it to a 64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-extend becomes a sign-extend, the program could reach backward and access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap. In addition to assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable.

CVE-2021-32638,Candidate,"Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/security/advisories/GHSA-g36v-2xff-pv5m   |   URL:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/security/advisories/GHSA-g36v-2xff-pv5m   |   MISC:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/58defc0652e935f6f2ffc70a82828b98d75476fb   |   URL:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/58defc0652e935f6f2ffc70a82828b98d75476fb   |   MISC:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/88714e3a60e72ec53caa0e6a203652ee1f3fb1db   |   URL:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/88714e3a60e72ec53caa0e6a203652ee1f3fb1db   |   MISC:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/codeql-bundle-20210304   |   URL:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/codeql-bundle-20210304   |   MISC:https://www.netmeister.org/blog/passing-passwords.html   |   URL:https://www.netmeister.org/blog/passing-passwords.html",Assigned (20210512),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json.

CVE-2021-3308,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1 through 4.14.x. An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter case, this would affect the entire host.","FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-16c9c40d4d   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S5C42TMQYB6SDVT2MPFEWY65A6RSUVBN/   |   MISC:http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-360.html   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210126 Xen Security Advisory 360 v2 (CVE-2021-3308) - IRQ vector leak on x86   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/26/4",Assigned (20210126),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-3450,Candidate,"The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a ""purpose"" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named ""purpose"" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.
