            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-3672 / XSA-180

                       Unrestricted qemu logging

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When the libxl toolstack launches qemu for HVM guests, it pipes the
output of stderr to a file in /var/log/xen.  This output is not
rate-limited in any way.  The guest can easily cause qemu to print
messages to stderr, causing this file to become arbitrarily large.

IMPACT
======

The disk containing the logfile can be exausted, possibly causing a
denial-of-service (DoS).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 systems are affected; ARM systems are not affected.

Only systems running HVM guests are affected; systems running only PV
guests are not affected.

Both qemu-upstream and qemu-traditional are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andrew Sorensen of leviathansecurity.com.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

The patches adopt a simple and rather crude approach which is
effective at resolving the security issue in the context of a Xen
device model.  They may not be appropriate for adoption upstream or in
other contexts.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team&#39;s decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community&#39;s agreed Security Policy:
