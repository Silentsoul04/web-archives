Subject: [PATCH 08/23] oxenstored: replay transaction upon conflict

The existing transaction merge algorithm keeps track of the least upper bound
(longest common prefix) of all the nodes which have been read and written, and
will re-combine two stores which have disjoint upper bounds. This works well for
small transactions but causes unnecessary conflicts for ones that span a large
subtree, such as the following ones used by the xapi toolstack:

 * VM start: creates /vm/... /vss/... /local/domain/...
   The least upper bound of this transaction is / and so all
   these transactions conflict with everything.

 * Device hotplug: creates /local/domain/0/... /local/domain/n/...
   The least upper bound of this transaction is /local/domain so
   all these transactions conflict with each other.

If the existing merge algorithm cannot merge and commit, we attempt
a /replay/ of the failed transaction against the new store.

When we replay the requests we check whether the response sent to the client is
the same as during the first attempt at the transaction. If the responses are
all the same then the transaction replay can be committed. If any differ then
the transaction replay must be aborted and the client must retry.

This algorithm uses the intuition that the transactions made by the toolstack
are designed to be for separate domains, and should fundamentally not conflict
in the sense that they don't read or write any shared keys. By replaying the
transaction on the server side we do what the client would have to do anyway,
only we can do it quickly without allowing any other requests to interfere.
