                    Xen Security Advisory XSA-289
                              version 3

               Cache-load gadgets exploitable with L1TF

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Rewrite text for technical accuracy.  Previous references to Spectre v1
gadgets were not correct.  In particular, the Xen Security Team is still
unaware of any Spectre v1 gadgets in Xen.

State that x86 PV guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.

Mention use of xen-hptool, and xl global affinity masks, as possible
mitigation approaches.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Previously reported vulnerabilities CVE-2017-5753 / XSA-254 (Spectre V1)
and CVE-2018-3646 / XSA-273 (L1TF) can, when combined, be leveraged to
more easily gather leaked information.

A Spectre v1 gadget is a speculation sequence which starts with a
conditional branch, contains a memory load who&#39;s address is
attacker-influenced, and a second action dependent on the content of the
first memory load, which opens a sidechannel with the attacker.

These gadgets are rare in code, and so far, none have been discovered in
Xen.  However, the first half of this gadget (i.e. to the first memory
load) is a very common sequence to find in compiled C, and forms an
arbitrary cache-load gadget.

An attacker can combine cache-load gadgets like this to bring data into
the cache on on hyperthread of a given CPU core, while L1TF is used on
another hyperthread to read the cached data.

A number of specific exploitable gadgets have been identified.

There are no new vulnerabilities.  There is only new information about
existing vulnerabilities: specifically, confirmation that existing,
previously disclosed, vulnerabilities, can be exploited in specific
ways.  (Previously, it was merely expected, and stated in XSA-254 and
XSA-273, that such the vulnerabilities would be exploitable.)

IMPACT
======

An attacker can potentially read arbitrary host RAM.  This includes data
belonging to Xen, data belonging to other guests, and data belonging to
different security contexts within the same guest.

An attacker could be a guest kernel (which can manipulate the pagetables
directly), or could be guest userspace either directly (e.g. with
mprotect() or similar system call) or indirectly (by gaming the guest
kernel&#39;s paging subsystem).

See XSA-254 and XSA-273 for more general information about the
underlying vulnerabilities.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 processors are vulnerable.  ARM processors are not known to be
affected.

Only systems with Symmetric Multi Threading (SMT, aka hyperthreading)
available and enabled are vulnerable.

Only Intel Core based processors (from at least Merom onwards) are
potentially affected.  Other processor designs (Intel Atom/Knights
range), and other manufacturers (AMD) are not known to be affected.

Only x86 HVM or PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 PV guests
cannot exploit the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

As discussed in XSA-273, disabling SMT / hyperthreading will avoid the
L1TF vulnerability.  It will therefore prevent the use of the
exploitable code patterns discussed in this advisory.  Disabling SMT
may be achieved via a BIOS option (preferred) or the &quot;smt=0&quot;
hypervisor command line option, or at runtime using `xen-hptool`, or by
using the xl global affinity masks.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Norbert Manthey, Julian Stecklina, and
Pawel Wieczorkiewicz of the Xen Security Team at Amazon.

RESOLUTION
==========

These are hardware bugs, so technically speaking they cannot be
properly fixed in software.

See XSA-273 and XSA-254 for a fuller discussion of the general
situation, background, etc.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

For the specific technical details of the now-known-explitable code
patterns, please see the attached patches.

These patches are intended by their authors to mitigate these
vulnerabilities.  In some form they are likely to be included in
future Xen releases.  We very much welcome this contribution to the
Xen community&#39;s response to Spectre/L1TF.

However:

 * These patches have not been validated by the Xen Project
   Security Team.  Work is ongoing.

 * We expect that there may be other exploitable code patterns and
   gadgets, similar to but beyond those disclosed here.

 * Should further such exploitable code patterns be discovered, we
   will not necessarily issue a further advisory, or update this
   advisory.  Instead, we would usually recommend that any
   improvements to reduce the exploitability be handled in public, in
   accordance with the public status of the underlying vulnerabilities
   XSA-273 and XSA-254.

 * We therefore do not recommend responding to this advisory by
   applying these patches.  Instead, we recommend using hardware
   without this bug, or failing that, disabling hyperthreading (SMT)
   as discussed in XSA-273.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team&#39;s decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community&#39;s agreed Security Policy:
