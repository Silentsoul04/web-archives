Subject: [PATCH 01/21] libxl: Make copy of every xs backend in /libxl in
 _generic_add

We want to stop libxl trustingly reading information from the backend
directory (since this is, of course, writeable by the backend, which
might be a semi-trusted driver domain).

In principle it is wrong in current libxl for anything to try to
divine virtual device configuration from xenstore: the JSON domain
config ought to supply that, and xenstore should only tell us which
devices actually exist.

However:

Firstly, there are several existing places where configuration
information is retrieved from xenstore rather than JSON.  We do not
want to reen gineer this in a security patch.

Secondly, we want to make a security patch which can be backported to
versions of libxl without the JSON configuration machinery.

So we take the expedient approach of keeping a copy of the
configuration somewhere we trust, namely /libxl.  This is obviously
fairly low-risk, although it does write significantly more keys in
xenstore.

In this patch we make this change in libxl__device_generic_add.  This
is responsible for actually writing the vast majority of device
information to xenstore.  There are a few loose ends which will be
dealt with in a moment.

Likewise, changes to readers to use the new location will appear in
further patches.

This is part of XSA-178.
