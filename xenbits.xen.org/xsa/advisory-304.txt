            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-12207 / XSA-304
                               version 2

            x86: Machine Check Error on Page Size Change DoS

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Tweaked version recipes to make them easier to parse.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

An erratum exists across some CPUs whereby an instruction fetch may
cause a machine check error if the pagetables have been updated in a
specific manner without invalidating the TLB.

The x86 architecture explicitly permits modification of the pagetables
without TLB invalidation, but in this corner case, the impacted core
ceases operating and an unexpected machine check or system reset occurs.

This corner case can be triggered by guest kernels.

For more details, see:
  https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-machine-check-error-avoidance-page-size-change

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest kernel can crash the host, resulting in a Denial of
Service (DoS).  (This CPU bug may also be triggered accidentally.)

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 processors are vulnerable.  ARM processors are not believed to
be vulnerable.

Only Intel Core based processors (from Nehalem onwards) are affected.
Other processors designs (Intel Atom/Knights range), and other
manufacturers (AMD) are not known to be affected.

Only x86 HVM/PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 PV guests
cannot exploit the vulnerability.

Please consult the Intel Security Advisory for details on the affected
processors.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests avoids the vulnerability.

Booting Xen with `hap_2mb=0 hap_1gb=0` on the command line, to disable
the use of HAP superpages, works around the vulnerability.

Booting Xen with `hap=0` to disable HAP entirely, or configuring HVM/PVH
guests to use shadow paging (hap=0 in xl.cfg) works around the
vulnerability, but the performance impact of shadow paging in
combination with in-guest Meltdown mitigations (KPTI, KVAS, etc) will
most likely make this option prohibitive to use.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patches resolves this issue.

By default, Xen will disable executable superpages on
believed-vulnerable hardware, and report so at boot:

PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
=====================================

Disabling executable EPT superpages does come with a performance impact,
caused by increased iTLB pressure.  The overhead will be workload and
CPU dependant.

In configurations where guest kernels are trusted not to mount a DoS
attempt, the mitigation can be turned off by booting with `ept=exec-sp`.

In configurations where the guest kernels are not trusted, users are
recommended to measure the impact to their workloads as part of deciding
between fast and secure.

On Xen 4.10 and later, a runtime decision can be made between fast and
secure by using `xl set-parameters ept=[no-]exec-sp`.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

Despite an attempt to organise predisclosure, the discoverers ultimately
did not authorise a predisclosure.
