            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2016-6258 / XSA-182
                              version 3

                x86: Privilege escalation in PV guests

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The PV pagetable code has fast-paths for making updates to pre-existing
pagetable entries, to skip expensive re-validation in safe cases
(e.g. clearing only Access/Dirty bits).  The bits considered safe were too
broad, and not actually safe.

IMPACT
======

A malicous PV guest administrator can escalate their privilege to that
of the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

The vulnerability is only exposed to PV guests on x86 hardware.

The vulnerability is not exposed to x86 HVM guests, or ARM guests.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jérémie Boutoille of Quarkslab.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team&#39;s decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community&#39;s agreed Security Policy:
