            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-18422 / XSA-303
                               version 5

  ARM: Interrupts are unconditionally unmasked in exception handlers

UPDATES IN VERSION 5
====================

Canonicalize version ranges for easier parsing.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When an exception occurs on an ARM system which is handled without
changing processor level, some interrupts are unconditionally enabled
during exception entry.  So exceptions which occur when interrupts are
masked will effectively unmask the interrupts.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest might contrive to arrange for critical Xen code to
run with interrupts erroneously enabled.  This could lead to data
corruption, denial of service, or possibly even privilege escalation.
However a precise attack technique has not been identified.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All ARM systems are vulnerable.  x86 systems are not vulnerable.

On some platforms this issue could possibly be exploited by an
unprivileged userspace attacker.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julian Grall of Arm.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
