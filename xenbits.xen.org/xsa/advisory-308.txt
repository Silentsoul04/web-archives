            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-19583 / XSA-308
                               version 4

     VMX: VMentry failure with debug exceptions and blocked states

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Canonicalize version range for better parsing.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Please see XSA-260 for background on the MovSS shadow:
  http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-260.html

Please see XSA-156 for background on the need for #DB interception:
  http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-156.html

The VMX VMEntry checks does not like the exact combination of state
which occurs when #DB in intercepted, Single Stepping is active, and
blocked by STI/MovSS is active, despite this being a legitimate state to
be in.  The resulting VMEntry failure is fatal to the guest.

IMPACT
======

HVM/PVH guest userspace code may be able to crash the guest, resulting
in a guest Denial of Service.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are affected.

Only systems supporting VMX hardware virtual extensions (Intel, Cyrix or
Zhaoxin CPUs) are affected. Arm and AMD systems are unaffected.

Only HVM/PVH guests are affected.  PV guests cannot leverage the
vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.

Running HVM guests on only AMD hardware will also avoid this
vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by HÃ¥kon Alstadheim and diagnosed as a
security issue by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.
