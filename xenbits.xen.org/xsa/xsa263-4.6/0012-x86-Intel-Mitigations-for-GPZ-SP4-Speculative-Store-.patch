Subject: [PATCH] x86/Intel: Mitigations for GPZ SP4 - Speculative Store Bypass

To combat GPZ SP4 "Speculative Store Bypass", Intel have extended their
speculative sidechannel mitigations specification as follows:

 * A feature bit to indicate that Speculative Store Bypass Disable is
   supported.
 * A new bit in MSR_SPEC_CTRL which, when set, disables memory disambiguation
   in the pipeline.
 * A new bit in MSR_ARCH_CAPABILITIES, which will be set in future hardware,
   indicating that the hardware is not susceptible to Speculative Store Bypass
   sidechannels.

For contemporary processors, this interface will be implemented via a
microcode update.
