            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-19963 / XSA-276
                              version 3

        resource accounting issues in x86 IOREQ server handling

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Allocation of pages used to communicate with external emulators did not
follow certain principles that are required for proper life cycle
management of guest exposed pages.

IMPACT
======

A compromised DM stubdomain may cause Xen to crash, resulting in a DoS
(Denial of Service) affecting the entire host.  Privilege escalation
as well as information leaks cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only Xen 4.11 is affected by this vulnerability.  Xen 4.10 and older are
not affected by this vulnerability.

Only systems running HVM guests with their devicemodels in a
stubdomain are considered vulnerable.  Note that attackers also need
to exploit the devicemodel in order to have access to this
vulnerability.

Arm guests cannot leverage this vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.

(The security of a Xen system using stub domains is still better than
with a qemu-dm running as an unrestricted dom0 process.  Therefore
users with these configurations should not switch to an unrestricted
dom0 qemu-dm.)

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of ARM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team&#39;s decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community&#39;s agreed Security Policy:
