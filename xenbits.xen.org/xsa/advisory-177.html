                 Xen Security Advisory XSA-177

               Unused Xen Security Advisory number

DESCRIPTION
===========

There is no advisory with this XSA number.

NOTES
=====

This XSA number was at some point allocated by the Xen Project
Security Team.

However, before any advisory was actually sent (whether embargoed or
not), it became evident that the issue does not, in fact, require an
advisory.  This could be because the issue was found not to be a
security problem, or because it has been consolidated into another
Xen Project advisory.

To avoid confusion, we do not reuse advisory numbers, even if they
have only been visible within the Security Team.

This document is provided by way of reassurance.  The lack of a
similar statement for a skipped XSA number normally means that the
issue is being investigated within the Xen Project Security Team.
