            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-29570 / XSA-358
                               version 5

          FIFO event channels control block related ordering

UPDATES IN VERSION 5
====================

&quot;Unstable&quot; patch updated (needed re-basing).

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Recording of the per-vCPU control block mapping maintained by Xen and
that of pointers into the control block is reversed.  The consumer
assumes, seeing the former initialized, that the latter are also ready
for use.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS)
attack affecting the entire system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.3 and
earlier are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Amazon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team&#39;s decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community&#39;s agreed Security Policy:
