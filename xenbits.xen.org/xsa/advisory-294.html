            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-17348 / XSA-294
                              version 3

         x86 shadow: Insufficient TLB flushing when using PCID

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Use of Process Context Identifiers (PCID) was introduced into Xen in
order to improve performance after XSA-254 (and in particular its
Meltdown sub-issue).  This enablement implied changes to the TLB
flushing logic.  One aspect which was overlooked is the safety of
switching between shadow pagetables, which previously relied on the
unconditional flushing of a write to CR3.

With PCID enabled, a switch of shadow pagetable for a 64bit PV guest
fails to invalidate the linear mappings of the previous shadow
pagetable.  As a result, subsequent accesses to the shadow pagetables
may be deemed to be safe by the shadow logic (based on the old shadow
pagetable) but fault when made in practice.

IMPACT
======

Malicious 64bit PV guests may be able to cause a host crash (Denial of
Service).

Additionally, vulnerable configurations are unstable even in the absence
of an attack.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Only systems running 64-bit x86 PV guests are vulnerable.  Systems running
only x86 HVM or PVH or 32bit PV guests are not vulnerable.

Only systems with at least one PCID-enabled PV guest are vulnerable.

Systems where PCID or INVPCID are unavailable or entirely disabled are
not vulnerable.

Note that PCID is enabled by default for both 64-bit dom0 and 64-bit
domU when hardware supports it.  PCID acceleration has been backported
to the following versions:
 - Xen 4.11.x,
 - Xen 4.10.2 and onwards,
 - Xen 4.9.3 and onwards,
 - Xen 4.8.4 and onwards,
 - Xen 4.7.6.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM or PVH guests will avoid this vulnerability.

Disabling use of PCID entirely, by passing &quot;pcid=0&quot; or &quot;invpcid=0&quot; as a
command line option to the hypervisor, will also avoid this
vulnerability (albeit re-introducing the XPTI performance regression
use of PCID was intended to reduce).

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team&#39;s decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community&#39;s agreed Security Policy:
